## Info
Hi, I'm a 16 year old self learned programmer and I have been working on programming projects since I was 7. First I was mostly interested in programming my own games and modifying games such as Minecraft and Roblox. Now I use programming to solve everyday problems such as playing music with my friends in **Discord**. Now I have also developed an interest for developing tools such as controlling your computer with a **Midi** keyboard since another big interest of mine is composing music.
<br><br>
I have tried a number of different programming languages. First I started out with graphical programming in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and then switched over to **Python**. I also experimented with **HTML, Javascript and CSS** and created a couple of small web apps. In 2018 I created my first **Java** project and started with **C# in Unity**. That was the first time I got into **Object Oriented Programming**. In 2019 I started experimenting with **Arduino and C**. I built some small robots and circuits and then progressed to building a WiFi controlled car in C. This project included an Arduino, **esp32** and an **Android app** that controlled the car remotely. 
<br><br>
Right now I'm working with the **TTGO Smartwatch** platform to develop a fully customizable user interface from which I can start and stop my own applications. I'm also on developing bots on **Discord** that I use with my friends for playing and queueing music in voicecalls. 

## Projects

### Java Projects:
- [El Macho](https://github.com/et118/El_Macho) (2022) - A **Discord** bot that plays and queues music in a voicecall
- [El Mama](https://github.com/et118/El-Mama) (2022) - **Discord** bot framework that I use as a base for my bots such as El Macho
- [Midi Piano Player](https://github.com/et118/MIDI-Piano-Player) (2021) - A **Java** application that converts and plays midi files on a [Virtual Piano](https://virtualpiano.net/). I made this to play custom music in games such as **Roblox**.

### Websites:
- [Prime Calculator](https://et118.github.io/primeCalculator/) (2019) - A web app that calculates prime numbers using the [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) and allows you to download them as a text file.
- [Minecraft Map Calculator](https://et118.github.io/MinecraftMapCalculator/) (2019) - A web app that creates a teleport command from map to world space in **Minecraft**.

### C++ Projects:
- [T-Watch OS](https://github.com/et118/T-Watch-OS) (2021) - Software for the **TTGO T-Watch esp32** that has a number of apps including a Timer and a Stopwatch.
- [Midi2Key C++](https://github.com/et118/Midi2KeyCpp) (2022) - A **Windows** console application that translates **Midi** inputs from a keyboard to [Virtual Piano](https://virtualpiano.net/) keypresses.

### Lua Projects:
- [ComputerCraft Scripts](https://github.com/et118/CC) (2021) - Controlling game bots with **Lua** scripts in Minecraft.

### Abandoned projects:
- [Zombie: **Java**](https://github.com/et118/Zombie) (2020) - Tile world generation and collision code for a unfinished game
- [BlackJackHack: **Javascript + HTML**](https://et118.github.io/BlackJackHack/) (2019) - A **Blackjack** betting calculator web app that calculates your best possible bet depending on how many cards are left in the deck.
