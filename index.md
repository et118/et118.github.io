## Info
Hi, I'm an 18 year old self learned programmer and I have been working on programming projects since I first got my own computer. In the beginning I was mostly interested in programming my own games and creating mods in games such as Minecraft and Roblox. Now I mostly use programming to solve everyday problems and satisfy my urge to learn more, such as creating a music bot and an AI image bot for **Discord**. I have also developed an interest for developing third party tools for games, such as controlling your computer with a **Midi** keyboard or calculating the most optimal way to manufacture products in **Eve Online**.
<br><br>
I have tried a number of different programming languages. First I started out with graphical programming in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) but later switched over to **Python**. I also experimented with **HTML, Javascript and CSS** and created a couple of small web apps. In 2018 I created my first **Java** project and started with **C# in Unity**. That was the first time I got into **Object Oriented Programming** which has stuck with me ever since. In 2019 I started experimenting with **Arduino and C**. I built some small robots and circuits and then progressed to building a WiFi controlled car in C. This project included an Arduino, **esp32** and an **Android app** that controlled the car remotely. The next project was making firmware for the **TTGO Smartwatch** with the goal to develop a fully customizable user interface from which I can run my own applications.
<br><br>
My latest projects have been developing self-hosted AI bots on **Discord** in C# that I can use with my friends to generate custom images such as [El Gogh](https://github.com/et118/El_Gogh). I'm currently in the process of rewriting the whole bot to add new features and more customizable commands. You can check it out [here]("https://discord.gg/JfQyTbbSka").

## Projects

### C# Projects:
- [El Gogh](https://github.com/et118/El_Gogh) (2023) - An AI image generating **Discord** bot that can follow your prompts to create anything! [Try it out](https://discord.gg/JfQyTbbSka)

### Java Projects:
- [Midi Piano Player](https://github.com/et118/MIDI-Piano-Player) (2021) - A **Java** application that converts and plays midi files on a [Virtual Piano](https://virtualpiano.net/). I made this to play custom music in games such as **Roblox**.
- [LecternVideoPlayer](https://github.com/et118/LecternVideoPlayer) (2022) - A **Minecraft** mod that can play any video inside of a lectern. [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkzX5rl9VPw)
- [LecternVideoCreator](https://github.com/et118/LecternVideoCreator) (2022) - A standalone program that converts video files into a compatible format for **LecternVideoPlayer**. Separated into a separate project because of a very large dependancy that slowed the game down significantly.
- [El Macho](https://github.com/et118/El_Macho) (2022) - A **Discord** bot that plays and queues music in a voicecall. Made in **Java**, and based on **El Mama**.
- [El Mama](https://github.com/et118/El-Mama) (2022) - **Discord** bot framework that I use as a base for my bots such as **El Macho**.
- [BetterAnvils](https://github.com/et118/BetterAnvils) (2023) - A small **Minecraft** mod that removes the anvil max enchanting level.
- [Yokai](https://github.com/et118/Yokai) (2023) - A program that creates a custom **Minecraft** profile. This profile has the feature of automatically downloading the mods in Yokai's github branches upon starting Minecraft, making sure that your mods are always up to date.

### Websites:
- [Prime Calculator](https://et118.github.io/primeCalculator/) (2019) - A web app that calculates prime numbers using the [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm and allows you to download them as a text file.
- [Minecraft Map Calculator](https://et118.github.io/MinecraftMapCalculator/) (2019) - A web app that creates a teleport command from map to world space in **Minecraft**.

### C++ Projects:
- [T-Watch OS](https://github.com/et118/T-Watch-OS) (2021) - Software for the **TTGO T-Watch esp32** that has a number of apps including a Timer and a Stopwatch.
- [Midi2Key C++](https://github.com/et118/Midi2KeyCpp) (2022) - A **Windows** console application that translates **Midi** inputs from a keyboard to [Virtual Piano](https://virtualpiano.net/) keypresses.
- [MyWatch](https://github.com/et118/MyWatch) (2022) - Another attempt at making an OS for the **TTGO T-Watch**. This time it has a program that can capture WiFi handshakes and transfer them to a phone via **Bluetooth**.

### Lua Projects:
- [ComputerCraft Scripts](https://github.com/et118/CC) (2021) - A bunch of scripts for controlling automated bots from [Computercraft](https://www.computercraft.info/) with **Lua** scripts in Minecraft.
